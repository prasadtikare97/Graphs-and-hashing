1.Implement a C program that uses graphs and heaps.

Suppose you are given a list of cities and the distance from each other, represented as an undirected graph. You need to find if there is a path between two given cities.

To optimize the search for a path, you decide to implement a hash table to store the distance between two cities. 
The hash table should take the form of a dictionary, where the keys are represented as the pair of cities (e.g., (Flagstaff, Sedona)) and the values are the distances between them.




2. The hangman game is a guessing game where the user guesses letters until they figure out what the secret word is. In most versions of the game, the user has 6 chances to guess the correct word. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. If the user fails 6 times, the hangman is complete, and the user loses. If the user knows the secret word, they keep guessing the correct letters until the word is complete, which results in a win.
The goal of this assignment is to simulate the hangman game. Because we donâ€™t want to draw the hangman, we will just use textual messages to communicate the user of their status in the game. Follow the items below to complete your game step-by-step.
