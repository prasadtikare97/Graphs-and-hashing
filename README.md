Implement a C program that uses graphs and heaps.

Suppose you are given a list of cities and the distance from each other, represented as an undirected graph. You need to find if there is a path between two given cities.

To optimize the search for a path, you decide to implement a hash table to store the distance between two cities. 
The hash table should take the form of a dictionary, where the keys are represented as the pair of cities (e.g., (Flagstaff, Sedona)) and the values are the distances between them.
